                        Marcus Soddano (b. 1997, South-Korea) was adopted to Norway just months after he was born. He is
                        currently based in Bergen where he lives and works in his studio. Growing up Marcus started
                        drawing from an early age, and expressing himself artistically has always been his escape from
                        the world around him. After finishing a two year study-program in graphic design he decided to
                        pursue his childhood dream of becoming an artist and went on to study art in Bergen Art School
                        (KIB), where he would remain a student for two more years. No, having finishing his studies, he
                        sees himself as a small fish in a big pond trying to navigate his way and becoming the artist he
                        has dreamt to be. His artistic universe raises questions about himself, sin, luck and religion
                        and the existence of humanity. He is on a quest to fulfil his need to be heard and understood as
                        well as looking for answers. He does so by painting, illustrating and asking questions in a way
                        that goes beyond the verbal. “It is always more to it than what a person can see, you gotta open
                        your third eye to truly see everything” - Marcus Soddano
